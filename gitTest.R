# When making changes, navigate to github.com/zivepstein/datafest15
# and create a new branch online. For instance, this was created
# on a branch called testBranch. You should be more creative in your naming 
# so we have an idea about what it is. Then, use the RStudio git tool
# to "Pull Branches"; this pulls the remote branch to your local machine 
# where you can make changes to it. Continue with the changes you would
# like to make. When done, select the edited files and "Commit" them. You can 
# again do this using the git tool above. Near the upper left of the commit 
# panel, make sure you have selected the correct branch and are NOT commiting 
# directly to master. Once you have added your changes, use "Push Branch" to
# push the remote repository and submit a pull request to be included in master.
# Try following this workflow to add your $name below.
