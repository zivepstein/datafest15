# When making changes, navigate to github.com/zivepstein/datafest15
# and create a new branch online. For instance, the branch this is being created
# on it testBranch. You should be more creative in your naming so we have
# an idea about what is what. Then, use the RStudio git tool
# to "Pull Branches". You can now continue with the changes you would
# like to make. When done, select the edited files and "Commit" them. You can 
# again do this using the git tool above. Near the upper left of the commit 
# panel, make sure you have selected the correct branch and are NOT commiting 
# directly to master. After committing all of your changes but before
# pushing them to the remote repository, you should always "Pull Brnaches"
# one more time so that you get the most up-to-date master. Many a
# merge conflict are avoided this way. Once you're all set, use "Push Branch" to
# push to the remote repo and submit a pull request to be included in master.
# Try following this workflow to add your $name below.
